## How to use venv control

1) For the first time on a new machine call `create_venv.bat` to generate a local venv on your computer.
2) To install all required python packages run `load_requirements.bat`
3) If new packages are required open `start_venv.bat` and install with pip. To store these package for future use, save them to requirements.txt with `store_requirements.bat`.
